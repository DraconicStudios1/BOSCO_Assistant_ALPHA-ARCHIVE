# BOSCO ASSISTANT ARCHIVE

This is meant to document and archive BOSCO's alpha development. All scripts here are avaliable to be used as either a backbone for your own assistant software or incase you think the newer versions have too much.

I again emphasize; DO NOT USE MY CODE TO LEARN PYTHON, YOU WILL NOT GET FAR.

# ALPHA HAS ENDED, THIS REPO WILL HAVE NO FURTHER COMMITS.
